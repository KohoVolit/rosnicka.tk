<h2>Methodology of analysing vote events in the Czech Chamber of Deputies</h2>
<h4>Criteria of vote events selection</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">The aim is to select all vote events in the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic that are relevant to the environmental protection. In some cases, there are no valid arguments for why a vote event impacts environmental protection. Such vote events are excluded from the analysis. The remaining vote events, however, cannot be all included because individual vote events have varying impact on environmental protection. In some cases, a vote event concerns a major paradigmatic conflict in a key environmental area; in other cases, it is only a minor change of the law, implementation of an obligatory European Union directive, formal ratification of an international treaty or approval of a governmental report. Moreover, one bill proposal can be voted on multiple times. A simple summary of such vote events would lead to biased conclusions since various vote events have various weights. Therefore, we only select those vote events where actual impact on environmental protection is to be expected.</p>
<h4>Methodology of rating</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">For each representative, we summarize the number of vote events when the representative voted in line with our recommendation (i.e. in line with environmental protection). We can, therefore, construct a rating of representatives based on how often they supported environmental protection by their voting behaviour. Parliamentary party groups that correspond to political parties are evaluated the same way - for each vote event, we calculate how many representatives voted in line with our recommendation, out of all members of the party group.</p>
<h4>The process of rating</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are several rounds of selecting vote events. The Legislative Centre of the Zelený Kruh Association continuously gathers vote events as a part of its legislative monitoring activity for its member organizations. This list is then supplemented by vote events suggested by member organizations, media etc. in order to collect all vote events relevant to environmental protection. The final list is consequentially sent to the member organizations of the Zelený Kruh Association for consultations. After that, The Legislative Centre adds links and descriptions and compiles an abstract and an appendix containing vote events that were not selected. These materials are again sent to the member organizations for further consultations. The final product is introduced via a press release and/or press conference.</p>
